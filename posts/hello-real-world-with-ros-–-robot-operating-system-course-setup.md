On my first day enrolling on this course from edX. I initially ran through some Course Setup which entailed:

* Installing an Ubuntu Linux Operating System.
* Installing Singularity to invoke interactive shells.
* Setting up the Course Command Shell.

Here is an image of the final product of these tasks:

 After I setup the shell environment I went on to some theory and fundamental terminal commands to help with ROS.

Here is an image which shows the ROS Node and Topic Inspection commands that I learnt:

Here is an image which shows the theory that I have learnt so far behind ROS Application Types:
