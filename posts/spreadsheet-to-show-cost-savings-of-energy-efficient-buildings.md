The beginning specification of my task is outlined here:

![Task SPec](/images/uploads/carbonfootprintspec.png)

Additional information was given after a client consultation including some extra inquiries that I had about the task. However, I have chosen not to include these in this blog post for confidentiality reasons.

The work was handed back and forth to allow for any ambiguates to be addressed and improvements to be made. 

The specifications were met, and the client was incredibly happy with the following work
