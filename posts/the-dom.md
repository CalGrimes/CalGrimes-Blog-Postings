The featured image shows a code segment that includes code to either have an element with an ID "each" to either show or not show to the user.

If the display style = "none". The form with display as:

![Tip Calculator Form](/images/uploads/tipcalc.png "Tip Calculator Form")

Notice how the bottom element on the form is the "Calculate!" button.

Now when the display style = "block". The form displays as:

![Tip Calculator Form with output](/images/uploads/tipcalcoutput.png "Tip Calculator Form with output")

The form now reveals a new div element with other elements inside below the "Calculate!" button.
